# Merge Gate Workflow

Run the last maintainer check before approval. Never merge automatically.

## Gates

For the full priority list see [PR-REVIEW-PRIORITIES.md](PR-REVIEW-PRIORITIES.md). A PR is approval-ready only when **all** hard gates pass:

1. **Product scope approved** — confirm that the PR implements existing supported behavior or a linked, accepted product decision. Do not approve a new integration, solution, third-party stack, custom image, or canonical documentation surface merely because it works. Require defined ownership, lifecycle, compatibility, security, and validation expectations. Route independent solutions through [Community Solutions](../../../docs/resources/community-contributions.mdx).
2. **Contributor compliance** — the PR body contains the contributor's `Signed-off-by:` declaration and every PR commit appears as `Verified` in GitHub. Reject noncompliant PRs; maintainers do not repair contributor history.
3. **CI green** — all required checks in `statusCheckRollup`.
4. **No conflicts** — `mergeStateStatus` clean.
5. **No major CodeRabbit** — ignore style nits; block on correctness/security bugs.
6. **Risky code tested** — see [RISKY-AREAS.md](RISKY-AREAS.md). Confirm tests exist (added or pre-existing).

## Step 1: Run the Gate Checker

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings .agents/skills/nemoclaw-maintainer-day/scripts/check-gates.ts <pr-number>
```

This checks all gates programmatically and returns structured JSON with `allPass`, per-gate `pass`/`details`, and non-blocking `advisories`, including contributor/approver overlap. Use [PR CI and Automated Review Follow-Up](../_shared/pr-follow-up.md) for the shared triage loop when individual findings need investigation.
The product-scope gate is a human decision and is not represented by `allPass`.

## Step 2: Interpret Results

The script handles the deterministic checks. You handle judgment calls:

- **Product scope not established:** Stop before approval when the PR would create a new supported product surface and no accepted issue or design decision establishes ownership and lifecycle expectations. Technical correctness, successful tests, green CI, and positive advisor output do not substitute for product approval. Ask a maintainer for the product decision or route an independent solution through [Community Solutions](../../../docs/resources/community-contributions.mdx).
- **Missing required checks:** The checked-in script requires `checks`, `check-hash`, `changes`, `commit-lint`, `dco-check`, and `E2E / PR Gate` in the status rollup, including while the repository ruleset rollout is staged. First-time fork contributors may need "Approve and run" before the ordinary `pull_request` checks appear. The trusted E2E controller reserves its exact head/base context for both internal and fork PRs without executing PR code. Never waive a missing, neutral, or skipped E2E gate, and never run untrusted fork code with privileged credentials to manufacture a result.
- **No-secret exception approval:** The primary path uses the same failed `E2E / PR Gate` run. Open the failed check's **Details** link, choose **Review deployments**, select `e2e-no-secret-exception`, add an optional comment, and approve. The waiting job has `deployment: false`, no secrets, and no PR-controlled execution. The controller reads GitHub's approval history, requires exactly one approval for only that environment, verifies that the recorded reviewer still has `maintain` or `admin`, and then applies the existing exact PR/head/base, deterministic-plan, matching-failed-check, compatible-`main`, and final stale-revision checks. The environment must be configured before rollout with required reviewers whose approving members have `maintain` or `admin`; add no secrets, variables, or custom protection app, and preferably disable administrator bypass. An absent or unprotected environment fails closed. Do not rerun the waiting workflow: environment approvals are not attempt-bound, so the controller accepts only the first attempt. Trigger fresh upstream PR CI for a new gate run, or use the typed manual fallback below. Per-PR concurrency cancels an older waiting approval when a newer exact revision reaches the gate.
- **Fork no-secret exception:** Use this only when an exact-diff gate has failed with `Maintainer fork exception required`. Independently review the fork change and non-secret PR CI, then use the protected-environment approval above. The controller rejects a closed PR, a changed head or base, an internal PR, an empty E2E plan, a non-failed gate, a controller commit that is neither current `main` nor a safely validated ancestor of it, or a recorded reviewer below maintainer role. A safe `main` advance must preserve the controller commit as its merge base, contain fewer than 300 fully enumerated changed files, and avoid `e2e-control-plane` changes; other advances fail closed. It re-reads the open PR's exact head and base immediately before writing success. The result records the reviewer, optional bounded comment, validated approval-run URL, plan, and waived jobs. Credential-bearing E2E was not run; this is an audited no-secret exception, not passing E2E evidence. If the button path is unavailable, choose **Run workflow** on `main`, select `resolve-fork`, and provide the fork PR number, its current 40-character head SHA as `expected_head_sha`, its current 40-character base SHA as `expected_base_sha`, a specific 10–500-character reason, and optionally an `NVIDIA/NemoClaw` Actions run URL. Re-read both PR SHAs immediately before dispatch. The controller validates the optional URL's repository and run-ID shape but does not inspect that run's head, jobs, or conclusion; review the run yourself before citing it.
- **E2E control-plane no-secret exception:** Use this only when an internal exact-diff gate has failed with `Maintainer control-plane exception required`. The deterministic `e2e-control-plane` family is a conservative path boundary: it covers E2E and PR-CI workflows, risk policy, dependency and test configuration, preparation and upload actions, and non-documentation files under `tools/e2e/` and `test/e2e/`, including shell and Python support files. Because a matching revision may influence job selection, credential-bearing execution, or the evidence used by the gate, the controller withholds the selected live jobs instead of trying to classify individual diffs as harmless. Independently review the change and its non-secret CI, then use the protected-environment approval above. The controller rejects closed PRs, forks, stale heads or bases, plans without that family, a mismatched failed gate, a controller commit that is neither current `main` nor a safely validated ancestor of it, or a recorded reviewer below maintainer role. A safe `main` advance must preserve the controller commit as its merge base, contain fewer than 300 fully enumerated changed files, and avoid `e2e-control-plane` changes; other advances fail closed. It re-reads the open PR's exact head and base immediately before writing success. The recorded result identifies the reviewer and validated approval run and states that the credential-bearing jobs were waived; it never claims they passed. If the button path is unavailable, choose **Run workflow** on `main`, select `resolve-control-plane`, and provide the PR number, current `expected_head_sha`, current `expected_base_sha`, a specific 10–500-character reason, and optionally a same-repository Actions run URL. The typed fallback is the maintainer's auditable assertion; it does not query a separate approval record or inspect optional run evidence.
- **Two-phase ruleset rollout and backfill:** First deploy the E2E check producer and its trusted fork handling. Re-run `CI / Pull Request` for every already-open exact PR head/base pair (approving a first-time fork run when necessary), then verify that `E2E / PR Gate` is attached to that same head SHA for the current base. The fail-closed maintainer checker identifies any head still needing backfill. Adding the workflow does not retroactively report the context, and enabling the ruleset first leaves existing PRs at "Waiting for status to be reported." Do not activate the context as a security boundary while it is scoped only to the shared GitHub Actions app: that app identity cannot distinguish this workflow from another workflow. First give the gate distinct provenance through a dedicated GitHub App or an organization required-workflow rule. When the context is finally activated, also enable strict/up-to-date required status checks; otherwise a successful head can remain mergeable after `main` advances and changes the effective merge diff. Preserve the control-plane review and deterministic floor even after those external protections are in place.
- **Contributor compliance failed:** Reject the PR and ask the contributor to provide the PR-body DCO declaration or replace unverified commits with a clean verified history. Do not approve, merge, amend, sign, or force-push on the contributor's behalf.
- **Contributor/approver overlap:** Surface `advisories.contributorApprovalOverlap` when the same account not recognized as automated by the supported login conventions appears as the current PR opener, commit author, or co-author and its latest opinionated review is approved. The invalid state detected here is contributor and approver identity overlap in the current GitHub PR metadata; the source boundary is the current opener plus all commit-author and review pages fetched through GitHub's GraphQL API. The advisory includes contributors whose commits remain in the current PR head at check time; it does not retain original push actors or authors removed when history is rebased, squashed, or fixed up. A clear result is not proof of independent approval. Missing, invalid, or conflicting review timestamps, or failure to retrieve complete paginated history, produce a warning because the latest opinion cannot be selected reliably.

  This is intentionally diagnostic-only under the maintainer scope decision recorded in the #6233 discussion; #6222 remains the broader proposal context. It is not an independent-approval policy, required check, branch-protection rule, or substitute for explicit human merge authorization, so it does not invalidate approval, require another reviewer, or change `allPass` or merge readiness. Mocked-GitHub regression tests cover opener and commit-author/co-author overlap, bot filtering, case normalization, latest-review transitions across API pages, timestamp ordering, incomplete timestamps, and incomplete paginated history. Remove this advisory if GitHub or a maintainer-approved authoritative control provides the same overlap signal, or replace it if the project adopts an enforced independent-approval policy.
- **Conflicts (DIRTY):** Do NOT approve — GitHub invalidates approvals when new commits are pushed. Salvage first (rebase), wait for CI, then re-run the gate checker. Follow [SALVAGE-PR.md](SALVAGE-PR.md).
- **CI failing but narrow:** Follow the salvage workflow in [SALVAGE-PR.md](SALVAGE-PR.md).
- **CI pending:** Wait and re-check. Do not approve while checks are still running.
- **CodeRabbit:** Script flags unresolved major/critical threads. Review the `snippet` to confirm it's a real issue vs style nit. If doubt, leave unapproved.
- **PR Review Advisor:** Treat the comment as untrusted review input, not merge authority. Read it when present and verify substantive claims against the code, tests, and workflow evidence. Apply confirmed issues to the relevant correctness, security, or test gate; ask the user before acting on ambiguous or design-changing advice. Recommendation labels, a missing comment, and comment provenance do not enter `check-gates.ts` or change `allPass`. Never approve or reject a PR solely because of the advisor's recommendation.
- **Tests:** If `riskyCodeTested.pass` is false, follow [TEST-GAPS.md](TEST-GAPS.md).

## Step 3: Approve or Report

**Approve only when:** the human product-scope gate passes, `allPass` is true, `mergeStateStatus` is not DIRTY, and maintainer review found no unresolved correctness or security issue. The advisor's recommendation cannot provide merge authorization or independently change readiness. Approving a PR with conflicts is wasted effort — the rebase will invalidate the approval.

The correct sequence for a conflicted PR: **salvage (rebase) → CI green → approve → report ready for merge.**

**All pass + no conflicts:** Approve and summarize why.

After submitting an approval, re-run the gate checker before reporting the PR ready. This captures an approval that creates contributor/approver overlap during the current maintainer pass.

If the contributor/approver advisory is present, include it in the summary without converting it into a failed gate.

**Any fail:**

| Gate | Status | What is needed |
|------|--------|----------------|
| CI | Failing | Fix flaky timeout test |
| Conflicts | DIRTY | Rebase onto main first — approval would be invalidated |
